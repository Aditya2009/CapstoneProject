<h1>Details About Natural Resource Exploitation</h1>
<p>There are two types of natural resources: renewable and non-renewable. The 
    former are inexhaustible, like solar radiation, or their renewal is relatively 
    rapid, as is the case with biomass. Non-renewable resources are those that exist 
    in nature in a limited way because their regeneration involves the passage of many 
    years, such as minerals and fossil fuels — oil, natural gas and coal —.

Human beings are depleting the planet's natural resources and standards 
of living will begin to decline by 2030 unless immediate action is taken. 
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) warns that the current overexploitation 
of natural resources is generating an enormous deficit, as 20% more than can be regenerated 
is consumed each year and this percentage is growing steadily.

Thus, if we continue at this rate, we would need 2.5 planets to supply ourselves in 2050, 
according to the WWF itself. In turn, this organization shows that the world's population 
of fish, birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles declined by 58 % between 1970 and 2012 due 
to human activities and predicts that by 2020 this percentage will soar to 67%.

The exploitation of natural resources is the use of natural resources for economic growth,
 sometimes with a negative connotation of accompanying environmental degradation. It started 
 to emerge on an industrial scale in the 19th century as the extraction and processing of 
 raw materials (such as in mining, steam power, and machinery) developed much further than 
 it had in preindustrial areas. During the 20th century, energy consumption rapidly 
 increased. Today, about 80% of the world's energy consumption is sustained by the 
 extraction of fossil fuels, which consists of oil, coal and gas. Another non-renewable 
 resource that is exploited by humans is subsoil minerals such as precious metals that are 
 mainly used in the production of industrial commodities. Intensive agriculture is an 
 example of a mode of production that hinders many aspects of the natural environment, for 
 example the degradation of forests in a terrestrial ecosystem and water pollution in an 
 aquatic ecosystem. As the world population rises and economic growth occurs, the depletion 
 of natural resources influenced by the unsustainable extraction of raw materials becomes 
 an increasing concern.

<p>Natural Resources are getting destroyed by humans, if this will continue then next 
    generations like 2030, 2040 people will 
    face many issues. So pls grow plant in more amount so that the next generations will 
    not face issues.</p>
