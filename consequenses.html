    <h2>CONSEQUENCES OF THE OVEREXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>The uncontrolled consumption of natural resources has significant effects:
    Environmental:

The disappearance of habitats essential for flora and fauna and, therefore, the extinction of species. There are some 30 million different animal and plant species in the world, and of these, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says that, currently, more than 31,000 species are threatened with extinction.</p>

<p>33% of the world's soils are moderately to highly degraded, according to a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). If the erosion of fertile soil continues at the same rate, agricultural commodity prices will inevitably soar.</p>

<p>The exploitation of natural resources will create scarcity of agricultural products and therefore increase the cost.
    This will make normal living difficult. </p>
 <p> For Health

If we do not take care of the forests there will be fewer CO2 Nota  sinks and therefore more air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nine out of ten people worldwide breathe air with high levels of pollutants and seven million people die each year air pollution.</p>
