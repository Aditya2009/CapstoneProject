<h1>Types of Natural Resources Exploitations
</h1>
<p>
  1. Deforestation.</p>
  <img src="https://cdn.slidesharecdn.com/ss_thumbnails/deforestation-191210140010-thumbnail-4.jpg?cb=1575986877" alt="">
  <p>Deforestation refers to the decrease in forest areas across the world that are lost for 
      other uses such as agricultural croplands, urbanization, or mining activities. 
      Greatly accelerated by human activities since 1960, deforestation has been 
      negatively affecting natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and the climate.</p>
<p>2. Desertification.</p>

<p></p>
<p>3. Extinction of species.</p>

<p>Extinction happens when environmental factors or evolutionary problems cause a species to 
  die out. The disappearance of species from Earth is ongoing, and rates have varied over time. A quarter of mammals is at risk of extinction, according to IUCN Red List estimates.</p>
<p>4. Forced migration.</p>

<p>For people uprooted by disasters and other environmental changes, forced migration or 
  displacement constitutes a secondary disaster. Displacement often makes permanent many of 
  the losses incurred in disaster. ... Most large- scale displacement very frequently involves whole regions.</p>
<p>5. Soil erosion.</p>
<img src="https://gsoil.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/kwaad2.jpg" alt="">
<p>Soil erosion is a naturally occurring process that affects all landforms. In agriculture, 
  soil erosion refers to the wearing away of a field's topsoil by the natural physical forces 
  of water (Figure 1) and wind (Figure 2) or through forces associated with farming activities such as tillage.</p>
<p>6. Oil depletion.</p>

<p>Oil depletion is the decline in oil production of a well, oil field, or geographic area.
   The Hubbert peak theory makes predictions of production rates based on prior discovery 
   rates and anticipated production rates. Hubbert curves predict that the production curves 
   of non-renewing resources approximate a bell curve. Thus, according to this theory, when 
   the peak of production is passed, production rates enter an irreversible decline.</p>
<p>7. Ozone depletion.</p>

<p>Ozone depletion consists of two related events observed since the late 1970s: a steady 
  lowering of about four percent in the total amount of ozone in Earth's atmosphere 
  (the ozone layer), and a much larger springtime decrease in stratospheric ozone around 
  Earth's polar regions.[1] The latter phenomenon is referred to as the ozone hole. There 
  are also springtime polar tropospheric ozone depletion events in addition to these 
  stratospheric events.

  The main cause of ozone depletion and the ozone hole is manufactured chemicals, especially 
  manufactured halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam- blowing agents 
  (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), HCFCs, halons), referred to as ozone-depleting substances 
  (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by turbulent mixing after 
  being emitted from the surface, mixing much faster than the molecules can settle.
   Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, 
   which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).[3] Both types of 
   ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased.</p>
<p>8. Greenhouse gas increase.</p>

<p>The greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when gases in Earth's 
  atmosphere trap the Sun's heat. This process makes Earth much warmer 
  than it would be without an atmosphere.</p>
